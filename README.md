An round-based first person shooter.

## Current Progress

Right now, all I did was follow the instructions for setting up a [Source SDK 2013 mod](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013). All this is right now is a fork of [source-sdk-2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013).
